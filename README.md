# Portuguese-bank-prediction
Data science project of Portuguese bank product analysis report with machine learning model.
1. Technique (Modeling Approach Used)

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Selected after comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and MLP models.

Chosen because it delivered the best precision, recall, and F1-score among all models.

2. Performance (Measured Results)

Achieved ~92% prediction accuracy on test data.

Showed superior precision & recall for the “yes” class, solving the class-imbalance problem effectively.

Provided more stable and generalizable performance compared to SVM (91%) and MLP (91%).

3. Business Impact (Outcome for the Bank)

Enabled the bank’s marketing team to identify high-probability customers likely to subscribe to term deposit products.

Improved targeted marketing, reducing campaign cost and effort.

Helped increase conversion rates by identifying key influencing factors (age group 30–60, previous contact history, loan status, etc.).

Provided actionable customer segmentation insights to optimize outreach strategy and enhance ROI.

Tasks Performed 

Task 1: Prepared a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) report covering data quality, distributions, imbalance assessment, and key customer insights.

Task 2: Built and evaluated multiple ML models, selecting the best-performing Gradient Boosting model to predict customer product purchase likelihood.

Task 3: Delivered data-driven recommendations to the bank’s marketing team to increase customer conversion and improve campaign efficiency.
